## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test each journey independently** - Ensure each journey can be completed in isolation
2. **Test journeys in sequence** - Test multiple journeys in sequence to ensure proper state management
3. **Validate error handling** - Ensure all error cases are properly handled and reported
4. **Test edge cases** - Validate system behavior with edge case inputs
5. **Test performance** - Measure response times for each step in the journeys
6. **Test concurrency** - Ensure journeys work correctly when executed concurrently by multiple users
