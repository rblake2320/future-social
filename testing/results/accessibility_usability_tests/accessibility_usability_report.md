## Executive Summary

This assessment identified a total of **2 actionable findings** (excluding informational items) related to API accessibility and usability:

- **1 High** severity findings
- **0 Medium** severity findings
- **1 Low** severity findings

Note: Since this is a backend-focused project, accessibility and usability primarily relate to API design and documentation from a developer perspective.

## Detailed Findings

### API Accessibility Assessment

Evaluates API design for clarity, consistency, and ease of use for developers, including those using assistive technologies.

- **Low**: API documentation file (fs_project_documentation.md) not found. Could not assess documented error handling.
  - **Recommendation**: Provide comprehensive API documentation that includes error handling strategies.

### API Usability and Documentation Assessment

Evaluates the ease of understanding and using the API, primarily through its documentation.

- **High**: API documentation file (fs_project_documentation.md) not found or empty.
  - **Recommendation**: Create comprehensive API documentation. This is crucial for usability.

## Recommendations Summary

Based on the findings, the following key recommendations are made to improve API accessibility and usability:

1. **(Low)** Provide comprehensive API documentation that includes error handling strategies.
2. **(High)** Create comprehensive API documentation. This is crucial for usability.

## Conclusion

The assessment identified areas for improvement in API accessibility and usability, primarily concerning API design consistency and documentation completeness. Addressing these findings will enhance the developer experience and ensure the API is easier to understand and integrate.

Manual review and testing by developers, including those with disabilities, can provide further insights beyond these automated checks.
